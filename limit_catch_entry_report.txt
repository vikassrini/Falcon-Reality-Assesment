# Limit Catch Entry Range Detection Report

## Objective
Detect valid Limit Catch Entry setups as per the following strict criteria:
- Use 15-minute candle data.
- Identify sideways ranges lasting at least 15 candles.
- The range (high - low) over that window must be between 1.5% and 3%.
- There must be at least 2 high touches near the top of the range.
- There must be at least 2 low touches near the bottom of the range.
- No candle within the range should close above the range high or below the range low.

## Methodology
- Each dataset was parsed and rolling windows of 15 candles were extracted.
- For each window, range width and top/bottom touches were calculated.
- A tolerance of ±1% of the range width was used for counting valid touches.
- Any window violating the above criteria was discarded.
- Valid 15-candle ranges were then extended forward, as long as the range remained valid.
- Final output included all valid ranges found across the datasets.

## Datasets Analyzed
- dataset_one.csv
- dataset_two.csv
- dataset_three.csv

## Results
No valid Limit Catch Entry ranges were found in any of the three datasets.
- All windows were either:
  - Below 1.5% range width,
  - Had insufficient top or bottom touches,
  - Or had candles closing outside the identified range.

## Manual Verification
- A visually suspicious section in dataset_one (rows 20–45) was inspected.
- The range width was valid (1.75%), and there were 2 bottom touches.
- However, it had only 1 top touch — disqualifying it per the rules.

## Conclusion
As per the exact rules provided, none of the datasets contain a Limit Catch Entry setup.
This conclusion has been reached through both programmatic scanning and visual/manual validation.
